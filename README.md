# hello-world

Twenty-nine year old art school graduate that finally woke up.

I've backed myself into a corner being the only remotely techie person in a growing family-bakery turned regional-wholesaler. 

I just wanted to frost cakes, but it turns out I'm better with numbers and spreadsheets than I remember being a decade ago.
I started working here about a year ago. I started itemizing the inventory 11 months ago.
Now I'm the assistant manager to my former assistant manager.
I do inventory management, invoicing, ordering, and receiving in addition to my original job frosting cakes and helping customers.

Perhaps I'm taking "write a bit about yourself" too literally.

Sorry.

Code learning will be slow until it's useful for my day to day.

   Goals:
    
    Figure out wtf GitHub is all about
    
    Learn Python
      Apply Python to:
        Automate downloads of historic daily sales data exports
        Automate downloads of future daily sales data exports
        Scrape adjustment history tables from the Shopkeep Back Office website to generate a .csv
          Tag and organize based on item name and adjustment comments (e.g. "Waste 11.16.2016").                
        Automate downloading and combining inventory and sales data with adjustment history data into a Master Inventory
        Automate the generation of new orders for the commisary based on the Master Inventory
        Get back to frosting cakes and helping customers.
      
    Learn Linux (and don't give up just because it doesn't connect to wi-fi on its virgin boot)
      Create a Linux mobile desktop from a USB flash drive:
        Must be lightweight due to the work laptop being as old as the bakery and only having an 8gb thumb drive
        Must connect to wi-fi and printer over wi-fi
        Must be capable of basic web browsing, email, and word processing.
        Must have basic image editing capabilities
          Better than basic is a plus. My art degree is in a box under the bed, but I earned it
        Must play nice with Google Drive sync
        Must tell me I'm pretty
